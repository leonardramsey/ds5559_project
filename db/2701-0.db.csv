doyle-81-45,occasional sinking recently killed sperm whale curious thing fisherman yet adequately accounted
doyle-81-45,usually dead sperm whale floats great buoyancy side belly considerably elevated surface
doyle-81-45,whales thus sank old meagre broken hearted creatures lard diminished bones heavy rheumatic might reason assert sinking caused uncommon specific gravity fish sinking consequent upon absence buoyant matter

doyle-82-3,romans took joppa skeleton carried italy triumph

doyle-82-4,akin adventure perseus andromeda indeed supposed indirectly derived famous story st george dragon dragon maintain whale many old chronicles whales dragons strangely jumbled together often stand
doyle-82-4,thou art lion waters dragon sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning whale truth versions bible use word

doyle-82-5,thus one noble stamp even whaleman tutelary guardian england good rights harpooneers nantucket enrolled noble order st george
doyle-82-5,therefore let knights honorable company none venture say ever whale like great patron let never eye nantucketer disdain since even woollen frocks tarred trowsers much better entitled st george decoration
doyle-82-6,whether admit hercules among us concerning long remained dubious though according greek mythologies antique crockett kit carson brawny doer rejoicing good deeds swallowed thrown whale still whether strictly makes whaleman might mooted

doyle-83-1,sceptical greeks romans standing orthodox pagans times equally doubted story hercules whale arion dolphin yet doubting traditions make traditions one whit less facts
doyle-83-2,one old sag harbor whaleman chief reason questioning hebrew story one quaint old fashioned bibles embellished curious unscientific plates one represented jonah whale two spouts head peculiarity true respect species leviathan right whale varieties order concerning fishermen saying penny roll would choke swallow small
doyle-83-2,bishop jebb anticipative answer ready
doyle-83-2,necessary hints bishop consider jonah tombed whale belly temporarily lodged part mouth
doyle-83-2,seems reasonable enough good bishop
doyle-83-2,truly right whale mouth would accommodate couple whist tables comfortably seat players
doyle-83-2,possibly jonah might ensconced hollow tooth second thoughts right whale toothless
doyle-83-3,another reason sag harbor went name urged want faith matter prophet something obscurely reference incarcerated body whale gastric juices
doyle-83-3,objection likewise falls ground german exegetist supposes jonah must taken refuge floating body dead whale even french soldiers russian campaign turned dead horses tents crawled
doyle-83-3,besides divined continental commentators jonah thrown overboard joppa ship straightway effected escape another vessel near vessel whale figure head would add possibly called whale craft nowadays christened shark gull eagle wanting learned exegetists opined whale mentioned book jonah merely meant life preserver inflated bag wind endangered prophet swam saved watery doom
doyle-83-3,poor sag harbor therefore seems worsted round
doyle-83-3,still another reason want faith
doyle-83-3,remember right jonah swallowed whale mediterranean sea three days vomited somewhere within three days journey nineveh city tigris much three days journey across nearest point mediterranean coast

doyle-83-4,besides idea jonah weathering cape good hope early day would wrest honor discovery great headland bartholomew diaz reputed discoverer make modern history liar
